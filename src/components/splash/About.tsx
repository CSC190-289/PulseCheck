              PulseCheck was created to address the challenges of engaging
              students in large lecture halls. As classrooms grow, keeping
              students attentive and involved becomes a monumental task. Our
              goal is to bridge the gap between lecture and participation
              through interactive, real-time polls and quizzes. Developed by a
              team of passionate educators and developers, PulseCheckâ€™s mission
              is to enhance student engagement, provide instructors with instant
              feedback, and foster a more interactive, personalized learning
              experience.
