            PulseCheck was created to address the challenges of engaging
            students in large lecture halls. As classrooms grow, keeping
            students attentive and involved becomes a monumental task. Our goal
            is to bridge the gap between lecture and participation through
            interactive, real-time polls and quizzes. Developed by a team of
            passionate educators and developers, PulseCheckâ€™s mission is to
            enhance student engagement, provide instructors with instant
            feedback, and foster a more interactive, personalized learning
            experience.
