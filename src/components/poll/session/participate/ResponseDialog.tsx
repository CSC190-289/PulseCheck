   * @TODO
   * @tdhillon113
   * This component should only be shown when the session's current question is not null.
   * Currently, I'm working on a way to record responses.
   * Simillar to what we have now with display questions, this dialog shows the contents
   * of the question. However, I want the question's title to be in a title bar of the dialog.
   * I'd refer to the MUI docs I sent you about Dialogs and refer to
   * @see {@link src/components/headers/AppBar.tsx} to see how I made an app bar.
   * After the prompt of the question, below the app bar is the image of question if any,
   * otherwise render nothing.
   * Then, render the possible options the user select using radio buttons. I know that
   * types of questions can either be multiple-choice, multi-select, or a ranking poll.
   * For now, just treat it as multiple choice.
   * @see https://mui.com/material-ui/react-radio-button/
   *
   * If you can get this done by Tuesday's meeting, I'll be extremely impressed.
